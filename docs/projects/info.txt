[writeup for video:
A dog owner uses science-based methods to formulate better coaching techniques for other dog owners. 


Fraser Noble realised that dominance-based training was not the way to train his dog, Athos, which had gone through traumatic experiences prior to adoption.


He eventually enrolled in a diploma to get a better understanding of animal psychology and behaviourism.


After becoming a canine behaviourist, Fraser utilises his expertise to improve his coaching approach for Athos and other dogs that similarly experienced a rough past.


Find out more about Fraser’s journey in becoming a canine behaviourist in the video below.
